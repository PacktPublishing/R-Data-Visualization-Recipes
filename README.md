# R Data Visualization Recipes
This is the code repository for [R Data Visualization Recipes](https://www.packtpub.com/big-data-and-business-intelligence/r-data-visualization-recipes?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repository&utm_campaign=9781788398312), published by [Packt](https://www.packtpub.com/?utm_source=github). It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the book from start to finish.
## About the Book
This book is an update to our earlier R data visualization cookbook with 100 percent fresh content and covering all the cutting edge R data visualization tools. It is packed with practical recipes designed to help you master data visualization with R, in the easiest possible manner. It starts off with the basics of R plots and an introduction to creating maps and customizing them, before progressively taking you through various graphics packages such as ggplot2, plotly, and ggvis. Using real-world datasets, you will analyze and visualize your data as histograms, bar graphs, scatterplots, and more, and customize your plots with various themes and coloring options. The book also covers advanced visualization aspects such as creating interactive dashboards using Shiny.
## Instructions and Navigation
All of the code is organized into folders. Each folder starts with a number followed by the application name. For example, Chapter02.



The code will look like the following:
```
> install.packages(c('devtools','plotly','ggvis'))
> devtools::install_github('hadley/ggplot2')
```

First things first, download the latest version of R (https://cran.r-project.org/).
Additionally, recipes were written using a IDE named RStudio (free version). I do prefer to
write R codes under RStudio IDE; if you do not have the software yet, you can get it from https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/.
